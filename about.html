      <h2>What NYNightlife is</h2>
      <p>NYNightlife is a practical planning platform for New York nightlife. We are not trying to be another generic “top 10 bars” list. Our goal is to help readers make faster, better decisions about where to go, when to move, what to spend, and how to avoid low-quality nights caused by bad geography and weak sequencing.</p>
      <p>We focus on execution: neighborhood-first planning, route logic, fallback options, and real-world friction points like lines, transfer time, and budget leakage. In NYC, those details decide whether a night feels premium or frustrating.</p>

      <h2>How we approach nightlife recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neighborhood before venue:</strong> district choice drives most night-quality outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision speed over noise:</strong> we prioritize usable frameworks, not endless options.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical constraints:</strong> we account for timing, spend, and movement reality.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeatable planning:</strong> readers should be able to reuse our guidance every weekend.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That means our guides, rankings, and tools are built as a connected system: start with a hub, narrow by intent, pressure-test with planner tools, then execute with a clear primary and backup route.</p>

      <h2>Who this site is for</h2>
      <p>We serve two core audiences: NYC locals optimizing their weekends and visitors who want high-confidence nights without trial-and-error. Some readers want nightlife value under a strict budget. Others want premium, reservation-led arcs. Both groups benefit from one thing: clear structure before the night starts.</p>
      <p>If you want to explore quickly, start with <a href="./weekend/">Weekend Hub</a>, then use <a href="./tools/nyc-night-planner.html">Night Planner</a> to finalize your sequence.</p>
