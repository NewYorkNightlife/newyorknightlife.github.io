# Visual Redesign: From Arcade Neon to Luxury Elegance

This PR transforms the entire visual design from electric Times Square arcade to **sophisticated urban luxury nightlife** — while keeping all functionality, content, and information architecture identical.

## Design Direction

**Before:** Electric neon arcade, bright colors, flashy animations
**After:** Fifth Avenue after dark, champagne bars, sleek luxury

Think:
- Modern luxury nightlife brand
- Champagne bar with skyline views  
- High-end hotel website elegance
- Sleek app dashboard clarity
- NOT retro, NOT loud, NOT arcade

## Color Palette — Refined Elegance

**Primary Colors:**
- Midnight Black (#0d0d0d) — primary background
- Charcoal Gray (#1a1a1a) — depth layers
- Rich Black (#0a0a0a) — darkest elements

**Accent Colors:**
- Soft Gold (#c9ad6d) — primary accent, warm and refined
- Champagne (#e8d9b7) — secondary, elegant highlights
- Steel Blue (#4b5d67) — sophisticated secondary accent
- Urban Night Blue (#1c2733) — depth backgrounds

**Text:**
- Off-white (#f2f2f2) — primary text, readable
- Light Gray (#c7c7c7) — secondary text

## Typography — Elegant Hierarchy

**Headlines:** Playfair Display (elegant serif)
- Bold, editorial style
- Clear hierarchy
- Refined, not bulky

**Body:** Inter (clean sans-serif)
- Readable at all sizes
- Modern, professional
- Weight: 300-700 for hierarchy

## UI Components

**Buttons:**
- Soft shadows (no neon glow)
- Rounded corners
- Champagne hover state
- Smooth transitions

**Cards:**
- Light borders or subtle shadow
- Balanced spacing
- Gradient overlays on hover

**Motion & Animation:**
