# Editorial Truth + Audit Policy (Permanent)

## Non-negotiable truth rule
- Never publish fabricated information.
- Never publish fake events, specials, discounts, listings, or news.
- If uncertain, do not publish.

## Source requirement
- Use inline citations in post body + clickable source links section at bottom.
- For time-sensitive or commercial claims (specials, discounts, lineups, listings):
  - minimum **3 independent sources** before publish.

## Weekly publishing cadence
- Friday posts publish at **2:00 PM America/New_York**.
- Backfill archive also uses Friday 2:00 PM ET timestamps.

## 3-PR audit cadence (permanent)
After every 3 merged PRs:
1. Pause delivery.
2. Run full bird’s-eye audit:
   - factual quality
   - UX/usability
   - monetization alignment
   - strategy drift
3. Fix issues found before continuing next PR block.
4. Report audit summary in Telegram.

## Goal alignment checks
Every audit should confirm:
- short-term monetization path remains realistic
- site usefulness + stickiness are improving
- content depth is increasing on high-intent pages
