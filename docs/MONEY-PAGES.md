# Money Pages Priority Module (Sprint 2 Step 6)

Adds a reusable "Priority Pages" module on key hub pages to focus production on high-intent pages first.

## Injected on hubs
- /guides/
- /tools/
- /rankings/
- /tonight/
- /weekend/

## Event tracking
- `money_page_click`

## Why
Keeps execution focused on pages most likely to drive planning behavior and monetization, instead of spreading effort across low-intent pages early.
