# Monetization Sprint (Phase B)

## Objective
Move from content-complete foundation to first recurring affiliate revenue.

## 14-day priority sequence

1. Affiliate approvals in flight (Booking, Viator, GetYourGuide)
2. Deploy approved links on highest-intent pages first
3. Validate click tracking + destination integrity
4. Add weekly performance review loop

## Highest-intent deployment queue (first pass)

1. `/visit/where-to-stay-for-nightlife-nyc.html`
2. `/guides/stay-near-nightlife.html`
3. `/weekend/nyc-nightlife-this-weekend.html`
4. `/things-to-do/nyc-night-cruises-and-ferry-experiences.html`
5. `/guides/best-nightlife-experiences.html`
6. `/tools/nyc-night-planner.html`

## Definition of done (first revenue-ready state)

- [ ] 3 core affiliate applications submitted
- [ ] At least 1 core program approved
- [ ] Approved links live on top 6 pages
- [ ] `affiliate_link_click` events visible in GA4
- [ ] Weekly report posted (clicks, pages, CTR direction)

## Weekly review cadence

- Monday: approval status + blocker removal
- Wednesday: link QA + event QA
- Friday: click report + next-page rollout
