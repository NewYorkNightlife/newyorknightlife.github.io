# Trust + Policy Completeness (Step 8)

This step closes core trust-policy gaps before content scale.

## Added pages

- `/affiliate-disclosure.html`
- `/methodology/editorial-policy.html`

## Methodology alignment updates

- Updated `/methodology/index.html` to include:
  - How We Rate Venues
  - Editorial Policy
  - Affiliate Disclosure

## Legal/footer visibility updates

- Added links to Affiliate Disclosure + Methodology in:
  - `privacy-policy.html`
  - `terms.html`
  - `index.html` footer links

## Why
