# Schema Standards (Sprint 2 Step 3)

## Added in this step

CollectionPage JSON-LD added to core hub pages:
- `/guides/`
- `/neighborhoods/`
- `/tools/`
- `/rankings/`
- `/tonight/`
- `/weekend/`

## Purpose

- Improve search understanding of page type and hierarchy
- Reinforce that these are navigational hub pages within the NYC Nightlife site architecture

## Next schema expansion targets

1. Guide/article pages:
   - `Article`
   - `BreadcrumbList`
2. Ranking pages:
   - `ItemList`
3. FAQ-heavy pages:
   - `FAQPage` (only where visible FAQ content exists)

Keep schema aligned with visible on-page content.
